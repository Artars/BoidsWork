# BoidsWork
Done by Artars and Dofee
Some work for my Cientific Iniciation along with a friend of mine.
Boids are particles wich fallow 3 simple rules:
  - Atraction to others boids
  - Repulsion to closer boids
  - Same Orientation of closer boids

Working with this 3 forces, and the neighboor distance, we can observe diferent behaviours.
This code is written in python 2.7 and demands the matplotlib and numpy libraries.
